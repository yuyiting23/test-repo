$ git branch -a

$ git add -A

#Commit first (sync) at the local repo
$ git commit -m "rename file "

$ git pull origin master





===========Common Workflow===============

###Create a branch for desired feature
$ git branch test_branch

#List all the local branches(defualt is the master branch before checking out)
$ git branch

#Switch to that newly created branch, and inpect it 
$ git checkout test_branch
$ git branch

#After we modified something on the test_branch, we need to do the same things as before
#Noted, there has no effect on our local master branch, and no effect on the remote repo
$ git status
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "new line of test.txt on test_branch"

#After commit, push branch to remote
#"-u", basically associate "the local test_branch" to "the remote test_branch"
#so that in the future, we can simply use "git pull, git push", instead of specifying details
$ git push -u origin test_branch

#To see all the branches, locally and remotely
$ git branch -a 



###Merge a branch 
#First checkout "local" master branch 
$ git checkout master

#Pull all the changes down before commiting to master,
#in case any changes were made while we are working on the features
$ git pull origin master 

#To find the branches we have merged so far. 
#Result shows Only "master", because we haven't merged anything back to the master branch yet 
$ git branch --merged

#Merge the test_branch to the local master branch
$ git merge test_branch

#Push it to the remote repo
$ git push origin master 


###Deleting a branch
#Inpect what have been merged to the master branch
$ git branch --merged

#Delete the local branch 
$ git branch -d test_branch

#Check whether the local test_branch has been deleted 
$ git branch -a

#Delete the remote branch
$ git push origin --delete test_branch 

#Inspect the result
$ git branch -a
